# React Weather App

This is a simple weather app that I created using React JS, it is powered by OpenWeatherAPI

It uses Hooks and API calls to get the job done

Feel free to mess around with the source code to see how I made it !

Just enter the location in the search box and hit enter to get the latest temperature and weather update !
